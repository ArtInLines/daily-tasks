# Coding-Problems

Solving coding prompts & problems (for example from [leetcode.com](https://www.leetcode.com)) and training different languages with these problems.

## Requirements for Tests

-   For each programming language that's used, a seperate "test"-file must be located in the root-folder
-   All Tests must be written as json files either called "examples.json" or "tests.json"
-   All Tests must be lists of individual tests
-   Each test can be stored as an array or object
    -   If stored as an array, the array must have exactly two elements, with the first being the input and the second being the output
    -   If stored as an object, the object must have the two keys "in" and "out"
-   Inputs/Oututs can be any type

## TODO

-   Mark all unfinished files as such
-   Add tests for different programming languages
